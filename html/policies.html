Casio reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time. Casio does not endorse companies or products to which it links, unless it expressly states otherwise.

                    <p><strong>12. GENERAL.</strong> </p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>a. Casio maintains offices within the United States of America from which it may administer the Sites. Casio makes no representation that Materials in the Sites are appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where their content is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Sites from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not use or export the Materials in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations. You agree that any claim relating to the Materials shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, and you agree to personal jurisdiction therein<br>b. Casio may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current Terms because they are binding on you. Certain provisions of these Terms may be superseded by additional express legal notices or terms posted on particular pages of the Sites. Continued use of the Sites following any change constitutes acceptance of the change.<br>c. You may terminate your access to the Sites at any time. Casio may suspend or discontinue providing the Materials to you with or without cause and without notice. Casio may pursue any other remedy legally available to it if you fail to comply with any of your obligations hereunder.<br>d. Except as otherwise provided herein, all notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing or displayed electronically on the Sites by Casio. Notices shall be deemed to have been properly given: 1) on the date deposited for postal mail; 2) on the date first made available, if displayed in the Sites; or 3) on the date received, if delivered in any other manner. Notices to you may be sent to any of the addresses provided by you on any form on the Sites. Except as expressly directed otherwise by Casio herein or elsewhere in the Sites, notices to Casio should be sent to: Casio, Inc., 570 Mt. Pleasant Avenue, Dover, NJ, USA.<br>e. The failure of Casio to enforce any provision hereof shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce it at a later time.<br>f. You may not assign your rights or delegate your duties under these Terms.<br>g. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. All prior agreements, understandings, negotiations or representations, whether oral or in writing, relating to the subject matter hereof are superseded and canceled in their entirety.<br>h. If any provision hereof is adjudged to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the parties agree that the remaining provisions hereof will not be affected thereby, that the provision in question may be replaced by the lawful provision that most nearly embodies the original intention of the parties, and that these Terms for the Sites will in any event remain valid and enforceable.<br></p></blockquote>
